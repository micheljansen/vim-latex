Latex-Suite for Vim
===================

This is a mirror of the official vim-latex repository
for use in Vim Janus (https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).
It has some Mac-specific modifications to make it work
more sensible out of the box on Mac OS X,
such as using Skim for PDF sync etc.


Prerequisites
-------------
See the latex-suite docs for details. You should at least have 
(Mac)Vim, Janus and a latex distribution installed.


Installing
----------

Installing vim-latex with Janus is easy. Just add the following line
to your local rake definitions in _~/.janus.rake_:
> `vim_plugin_task "vim-latex", "git://github.com/micheljansen/vim-latex.git"`

Then, from inside the Janus installation in  _~/.vim/_ run:
> `rake vim-latex`
to install vim-latex.


Using
-----

Depending on your configuration, the vim latex suite might require
some additional fiddling in order to work.

If you get stuff like this:
> Error detected while processing function Tex_RunLaTeX:
> line    7:
> E121: Undefined variable: s:target
> E15: Invalid expression: s:target
Remember to set the target (PDF or DVI) in the Tex-Suite menu.
